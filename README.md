Official Stoneyard Skyblock 1.15 Survival website's repository 

## ABout Stoneyard
Skyblock is a completely void world where we start with very minimal resources on an island in the sky and build everything from it as we progress through the game. Our aim is to do large scale projects and construct huge farms with an ultimate goal of full automation for everything the game has to offer.

### Note
```
If you dont want to amaze yourself with rabbits in water and cows dropping from sky and sheeps turning into cave spider, make sure to get Fabric API and Quick carpet and Skyblock mods installed. You can download them from [Mods] (https://stoneyard.firebaseapp.com/mods)
