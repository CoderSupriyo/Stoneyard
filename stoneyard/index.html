      <p>Welcome to Stoneyard Skyblock Survival. Skyblock is a completely void world where we start with very minimal resources on an island in the sky and build everything from it as we progress through the game. Our aim is to do large scale projects and construct huge farms with an ultimate goal of full automation for everything the game has to offer.</p>
