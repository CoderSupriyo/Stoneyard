      <p class="line-1">Bored of the normal vanilla game? Minecraft feels too easy? Want something new and different?</p> 

      <p class="line-2">Maybe you have come to the right place. Welcome to stoneyard skyblock survival. Stoneyard Skyblock is a completely void world where we started on a small island in the sky which had some grass, a mycelium block and just a tree. We are gradually progressing through the game by using those minimal resources and constructing farms for everything we need. Our aim is to construct huge farms and projects with an ultimate goal of full automation for everything the game has to offer. Currently we are looking for members to join us and help us build a strong and friendly community to play with.
      </p>      
      <b>Note:</b>
      <p class="line-3">Stoneyard skyblock is a normally generated world with all blocks and everything deleted except some structures, so its a void world where we build everything. Not everything is farmable in this world using just the vanilla game mechanics. Stoneyard takes the help of Carpet and Skyblock mods to add some necessary features to the game. Make sure to install these mods. For how to download and install <a href="./mods.html">click here</a>
